# Rules

## Stats

### Savagery

- Power derived from exterior sources unwilling taken

### Pact

- Power derived from exterior sources willing given (through debts and contracts).

- Depending on the contract using the power can result in a decrease of
another stat.

- A positive Pact means that another entity owes you something, and negative one means
that you owe them something

- For each deal you make you are awarded pact points that can be spent and gained
to meet the terms of the contract. By default all players start with with the
Seal of Solomon Pact.

#### Seal of Solomon Pact

- If a player breaks an oath, and another player or creature can declare them forsworn.
If forsworn this pact is null and void (and all protections that come with it).
A new pact can be formed with a powerful entity, with negative pact points, to establish similar protections.

- The awakened gain skills, bonuses, and penalties associated with a being practitioner

- Awakening with iron gives a bonus (I am thinking in tools and Lore schools), while awakening with holy gives a bonus (in realms and protections schools).

- Awakening solo gives no bonuses. While awakening with a coven  a positive modifier ( I am thinking +3) when practicing (though -2 for every member of your coven missing). However for every interaction with unawakened is -1 for every member of your coven present (You guys give an creepy other worldly vibe when together)

- If awakened naked you get no bonus. If you awaken in full raiment, you have +1 for interactions with other when in full raiment,
-1 for partial raiment, and -2 for no visible raiment.
 For mortal tasks for full raiment -2 , -1 for partial, and 0 for none (raiment makes people think you are weird and gets in the way when moving).

### Blood

- Material Power

- Can be expended if you need to power for a spell, and have nothing else to draw on.

- Physical Harm will decrease this stat

- A negative stat means that you lose your body. You can remain in the game
as a spirit if circumstances allow (normally you are dead and need to make a new character)

### Essence

- Immaterial Power

- Split into two subcategories

#### Personal Essence

- Determined by your connections to the exterior world

- Usually increased by helping other humans, and having interpersonal relationships

- A negative number means you fall into limbo

#### Other Essence

- A measure of "Other" influence on you. If this number is higher then your personal essence you are "Other". This can take a number of different forms depending on the influence

- This stat is the source of power for Hosts and Heartless

### Karma

- Divine/ Cosmic Law

- When one point from a success or failure compare karma stats between parties.
Player with the higher karma choices what happens. The the higher player can choice
to gain a karma and lose the roll, or for the other player to gain a karma while they
lose a karma and win the roll. If the GM won, the action taken must make the other player
approach zero karma.
